# ImageCorrelation
This MATLAB code is to read multichannel tiff images over time and to calculate pearson's correlation coefficient and overlap across two channels within a mask. 

The channels are as follows:

Channel_1: transcription factor (TF)

Channel_2: DNA

Channel_3: RNA

Channel_4 and Channel_7: Mask for TF for allele1 and allele2 respectively

Channel_5 and Channel_8: Mask for DNA for allele1 and allele2 respectively

Channel_6 and Channel_9: Mask for RNA for allele1 and allele2 respectively

This is to see whether the levels of TF and DNA correlate with one another and how it varies over time.
